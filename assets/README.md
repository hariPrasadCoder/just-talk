# Assets Directory

This directory should contain the following image assets for the app:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `splash.png` - Splash screen image (1242x2436px recommended)
- `adaptive-icon.png` - Android adaptive icon (1024x1024px recommended)
- `favicon.png` - Web favicon (48x48px recommended)

For now, you can use placeholder images or create simple colored squares. The app will work without these, but they're recommended for a polished look.

You can generate these using:
- Online tools like [App Icon Generator](https://www.appicon.co/)
- Design tools like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop
- Or use Expo's asset generation tools
